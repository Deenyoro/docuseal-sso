# SSO Self-Healing Patches — heal-patches.sh
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Runs in CI (with a real git checkout) BEFORE the Docker build. Guarantees
# the unified diffs in sso/patches/ apply EXACTLY against the current tree —
# without manual intervention — even after upstream refactors shift the
# surrounding code:
#
#   1. `git apply --check`  → patch is exact, nothing to do.
#   2. `git apply --3way`   → re-anchor the change with git's 3-way merge
#      (survives context shifts, offsets, and nearby upstream edits that
#      make plain `patch` reject). The patch file is then REGENERATED from
#      the merged result, so drift never accumulates, and the refreshed
#      patch is committed & pushed back to the repo (set HEAL_PUSH_BRANCH).
#   3. If even the 3-way merge conflicts, upstream rewrote the very lines
#      the patch changes. No automatic answer can be correct — fail loudly.
#
# The working tree is left CLEAN apart from regenerated sso/patches/*.patch
# files: the Docker build still applies the patches itself, exactly as
# before. This script only guarantees they will apply.
#
# Requirements: git history for the pre-image blobs (actions/checkout with
# fetch-depth: 0). Blobless partial clones (filter=blob:none) are fine —
# git lazily fetches the blobs that `--3way` needs.
#
# Env:
#   HEAL_PUSH_BRANCH  branch to push refreshed patches to (e.g. master).
#                     Empty/unset = heal for this build only, do not push.
